* Automatically adds http:// to the URL if it is not already present.
* Clean and responsive UI.
* Visual feedback to users when history is cleared.
* Uses Chrome History API to manage browsing data.

3. Click the Clear History button.

## **Project Structure**
* **popup.html:** The main HTML file for the extensionâ€™s popup interface.
* **popup.js:** Handles the logic for searching and deleting browsing history.
* **styles.css:** The CSS file for styling the popup UI.
* **manifest.json:** The configuration file for the Chrome extension.
## **Chrome API Usage**
This extension uses the following Chrome APIs:

* chrome.history.search(): To search for browsing history based on the entered URL.
* chrome.history.deleteUrl(): To remove the specific URLs from the browsing history.
## **Future Enhancements**
* Time-based history deletion: Add options to clear history from specific time periods (e.g., last hour, last 24 hours, last 7 days).
* Multi-URL support: Allow users to input multiple websites at once for batch history clearing.
* Scheduled history cleanup: Implement an option to schedule automatic history cleaning for specific websites at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
* Bookmark integration: Give users the option to bookmark URLs before they are deleted, so important links are not lost.
* Partial URL matching: Allow partial matches or wildcard support for URL deletion (e.g., delete history for all subdomains of example.com).
